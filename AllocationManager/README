This project was developped using NetBeans.
It has been tested in deployment with Glassfish and the users authentication
should be specified for the Security realm of the application server. To do so,
go to a URL such as http://localhost:4848/common/index.jsf (according to your
own Glassfish configurations) and add the user admin (choose a password you
like) for the realm (file).
