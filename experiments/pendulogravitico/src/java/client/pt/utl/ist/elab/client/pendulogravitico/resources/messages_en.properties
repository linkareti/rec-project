rec.exp.description.pendulogravitico=<html><body> <p>This experiment consists on oscillating a pendulum with a rigid rod. <br> The pendulum's mass slides on the rod and it's possible to define the height of the mass on the rod. It's also possible to define the initial angle for the oscillation and the frequency for the angle acquisitions as the pendulum oscillates. <p> Historically pendulums are used since about the year 1600 and it's discovery and first studies are assigned to Galileo Galilei. <br> Its regular oscillation allows it to be used to measure time quite accurately until very recently, for regulating pendulum clocks for instance. <br> Pendulums were also used to perform the first measurements of the acceleration of gravity. </body></html>
