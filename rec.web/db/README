This project uses liquibase to perform the database upgrade, rollback, etc. operations.

0. The base.xml file was firstly generated from the existing database, on 2012-04-29, from liquibase, with the following statement
(notice that you have to download liquibase first), and edited after that for minor improvements: 
		
./liquibase --driver=com.mysql.jdbc.Driver \
--classpath=/home/gpereira/.m2/repository/mysql/mysql-connector-java-5.1.21/mysql-connector-java-5.1.21-bin.jar \
--changeLogFile=base.xml --url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/rec --username=root --password=root generateChangeLog

1. To upgrade the database, simply run the following statement:
mvn liquibase:update -P<profile> (where profile may be dev, qa and prod)

2. To perform a rollback of the operations executed, simply run the following statement
mvn liquibase:rollback -P<profile> (where profile may be dev, qa and prod) \
(choose one of 
-Dliquibase.rollbackTag=<tag of the script, if you have specified one>
-Dliquibase.rollbackCount=<number of changesets to rollback>
-Dliquibase.rollbackDate=dd-MMM-yyyy of the set to rollback)
